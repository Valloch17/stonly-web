# Stonly Builder Suite

Create, refine, and publish Stonly knowledge base content and guides from one place. The suite includes multiple builder tools that share the same account and team settings, so you can switch between workflows without re-entering credentials.

## Getting started

- Open `https://ai-builder.stonly.com`.
- Log in with email/password or Google (stonly.com).
- New users sign up with an admin token provided by a Stonly admin.
- Select a team in the Team selector. If you have no teams, create one first.

## Builder tools

### AI Builder

Turn a prompt into a guide draft quickly. Use the refine steps to iterate and improve the result. Best for fast, lightweight guide creation.

### Guide Builder

Prompt-to-guide with an extra Gemini enrichment step for more complex builds, including attachments. Use this when you need richer outputs or supporting files.

### KB Builder

Build knowledge base structures using Gemini. Ideal for generating or reorganizing folder trees and content foundations.

### Guide Publisher

Publish guides in bulk. Use it to push multiple guides live in one pass.

### Expert Mode

Combines KB Builder and Guide Builder into one workflow for full, end-to-end builds. Includes an automated mode to speed up larger runs.

## Accounts and access

- Email/password and Google login both map to the same account if the email matches.
- Password reset requires the admin token.
- Admin tokens are used only for signup and reset; they are not stored in your account.

## Teams and settings

Teams are saved to your account so you can reuse them without re-entering tokens.

- Team fields: Team name, Team ID, Team token, optional Root folder.
- Team token is required when creating or editing a team.
- The Team selector is always available; use "+ Create team" in the dropdown.
- Manage teams in Team Settings to create, edit, or delete entries.
- API base URL is an advanced global setting (not per team). Most users should leave it unchanged.

## Typical workflow

- Log in.
- Select or create a team.
- Open the builder tool you need.
- Build, refine, and publish.
